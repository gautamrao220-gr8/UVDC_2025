Designed a multi-functional Remotely Operated Vehicle (ROV) capable
of pioneering a new frontier of underwater exploration. The ROV will perform comprehensive tasks, including the 3D mapping and reconstruction of complex cave systems,
real-time detection and reporting of environmental anomalies, and the continuous logging
of vital geographical data. Central to this mission is the ability to conduct non-invasive
marine biology analysis and analyze soil and water samples, all while prioritizing ecological safety and ensuring zero disruption to the delicate underwater ecosystem.
